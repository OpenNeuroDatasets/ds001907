This project contains 46 healthy aging (n = 25, RC41\*) participants and
participants with Parkinson's disease (n = 21, RC42\*) at two sessions each. At
each session, subjects acquired 6 repetitions of the ANT task (1-6). ANT task
scans are the same by number across subjects, although they were presented in 
varying orders. Task timing, anatomical scans, resting scans, and DTI scans 
by session are also included.

The `derivatives/` directory contains AFNI-preprocessed scans as well as
anatomical scans skullstripped before defacing. The derivatives have been
slice-timing corrected already, so 0s are provided for that field.

At the top level is complete demographic information and the AFNI script for
preprocessing.

Exceptions
----------
One subject (RC4206) had an acquisition error during their second session
structural scan. Correspondingly, their structural scan from their first
session has been copied for their second session to create a valid
BIDS directory.

DTI scans are not present for four subjects for the first session (RC4106, RC4204,
RC4205, RC4226) and three subjects for the second session (RC4103, RC4106, RC4205).

DTI scans for the first session of two participants have a larger dimension
size compared to other DTI scans (RC4101, RC4201).
